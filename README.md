# MKR Vidor 4000 Dive 

This repository is my exploration of the MKR Video 4000 development board. 
At this stage, I am mostly exploring tooling and diving into the current board
support. Currently, I am looking into
- [ ] packaging all tooling into a nix flake for a streamlined development workflow
    - [x] bossac
    - [x] createCompositeBinary
    - [ ] Rust Toolchain
    - [ ] Chisel Toolchain 
- [ ] embedded Rust firmware on the Cortex-M0+ MCU
- [ ] Chisel HLHDL on the FPGA
